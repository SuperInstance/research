Registered artifacts (verbatim, not invented): tavern/jev_calibration_battery_r8.json (lane 0.07 / JEV r8 0.15), tavern/jev_remap_r9_rows.jsonl (JEV r9 priors 0.13 / 0.14). Everything not in the registration (sign-lane fix landed, letter acknowledged, …) is watch context only and is NEVER scored here.
