# Handoff — for keeper, Claude, CCC, and anything else writing into this fleet

You are picking up work that another agent has already measured. This brief is what is
**known**, what is **open**, and what you should **not** spend a round rediscovering.

Everything below is in `quilt-research-canons/research/`, most files merged to `main`.

---

## 1. The one-paragraph position

The account has **4,856 repos, 33 stars, 4 forks, 86 followers**, and about 20 live ones.
The work is rigorous and almost entirely **internal**: verified by the person who wrote
it, in a second language, on the same substrate. That is the problem, and every other
problem is downstream of it.

The stated ambition — an external, auditable substrate that grows richer rather than a
model that gets bigger — is coherent and, as of this week, has its first runnable
artifact. The gap is legibility, not quality.

---

## 2. What is MERGED and live

| what | where | state |
|---|---|---|
| dependency-closed artifact | `SuperInstance/quilt-c` v0.1.0 | **signed git tag**, CI green on a fresh runner, `make verify` = 1,285 assertions, 2.9s cold clone |
| **crates.io** | `quilt-c 0.1.0` | **published**, `cargo add quilt-c` compiles against the C99 kernel |
| **npm** | `quilt-c99-kernel 0.1.0` | **published**, `npm install` runs the 1,285 assertions on install |
| landing page | https://superinstance.github.io/quilt-c/ | live, self-contained, 0 broken links |
| fleet ed25519 signing key | `quilt-c/fleet-signing-key.asc` | published; `SIGNING.md` has the negative control |

**PyPI is blocked** — `upload.pypi.org` returns 405 from this sandbox egress. The wheel
and sdist are on the release and install by URL. Retry it, or wire a GitHub Action with
OIDC trusted-publisher, which is the durable fix and also makes the Action the external
actor rather than me.

## 3. What is OPEN and awaiting a decision (do not rebuild these)

| repo | PR | what |
|---|---|---|
| `quilt-c` | **#5** | A2A cell API reference implementation, 13/13 |
| `fleet-seeds` | **#2** | externalisability gate, 0/10 currently pass |
| `AI-Writings` | **#70** | Bell-witness verifier + JEV known-answer control |

If you merge any of these, say so in the receipt. If you replace one, the replacement
needs its own negative controls — see §5.

---

## 4. What is MEASURED. Do not re-derive these; extend them.

### 4.1 The canon gate is a step function, not a scale
`p > 0.7` on one JEV `noul` call. Bisecting a monotone evidence ladder, the single rung
that flips it is **adding the words "the file is append-only"** — the guarantee statement.
+0.690 in one step. Everything after that is inert: byte-prefix proof, fail-closed
validation, an independent reimplementation, a machine-checked formal proof. All worth
doing, all worth nothing to this instrument.

→ `research/jev-gate-experiments-2026-09-29.md`

### 4.2 Batching collapses for `noul` — unless each question names its subject
This is the most operationally important fact about the API and it took **eleven rounds**
to find, because rounds 1–6 were all right about the observation and wrong about the cause.

| batch shape | per-item spread |
|---|---|
| identical instruction, **unnamed** | **0.01** — collapses |
| identical instruction, **subject-named** via a fixed prefix | **0.57** — works |
| prefix naming the wrong subject | collapses |

The mechanism: a question that applies to the whole state gets the whole state's answer,
and N of those are the same answer. A question that says which part it is about gets
evaluated against that part. **The text does not have to differ — it only has to POINT.**

→ `research/jev-loop-rounds-9-11-2026-09-29.md`, `tools/jev_batch.py`

### 4.3 The rule set, current
```
noul, subject NAMED in the question   -> batches safely. Cheapest path.
noul, subject unnamed                 -> collapses. Never do this.
choice                                -> batches safely. Read the DISTRIBUTION, not the argmax.
score                                 -> batches safely but is a constant generator; grades
                                        nothing you would want to gate on.
```
Batching is **2.5x cheaper** than one-per-call once the prefix is there (545 tokens vs 1344).

### 4.4 `score` is a constant generator
Fed numpy, a 1,285-assertion reference port with green CI, and an empty shell, it returns
**2.500 / 2.500 / 2.500** in one run and **2.505 / 2.520 / 2.485** in another. Confidence
~0.62 throughout and **it does not drop to signal the failure**. Any `score`-based gate is
a hole. Known-answer control: `research/jevlab/jev_gate.py`.

### 4.5 0 of 10 sealed predictions are decidable by a stranger
Every one stated an explicit failure condition and every hash verified. The *pass*
conditions were presence-of-bookkeeping, and the auditor named the cheap way to satisfy
each one. **The fleet has falsifiers but not substance tests.**
→ `research/externalisability-audit-2026-09-29.md`

### 4.6 791 commits, 0 signed, 12 self-asserted author names, one account
An outsider cannot bind a commit to keeper vs Mavis vs Claude. This is why the two-reader
rule cannot be audited. **Per-agent GitHub Apps** is the fix and it needs Casey.
→ `research/attribution-audit-2026-09-29.md`

### 4.7 pong49 resolved, and it is n=1
The battery closed `false` — 0 foreign comments on `pong-quilt#49` in 48h. Brier 0.0049 –
0.0225 across four pre-registered instruments, all well calibrated. But the calibration
ladder is: internal artifacts < public API state < **an actual third party's unconstrained
choice**, and the fleet has **no data in the third rung**. 48 hours on one thread is not a
measurement of that.
→ `research/receipt-003-pong49-resolution.md`

## 5. The discipline, stated once

> **Every rule you ship needs a negative control that exercises the rule's own failure mode,
> not a restatement of the happy path.**

Six of seven bugs found in one session were found by a check that could have passed while
the rule was broken. The worst: a route builder whose guard was false on an empty list, so
**routes were permanently empty** — silent, total, and it made eleven positive tests pass
*for the wrong reason*, because nothing was ever posted.

Corollary: **a passing suite that cannot fail is worse than no suite, because it gets
consumed as evidence.** Break the thing on purpose and confirm the suite notices. If an
injected fault survives, the fault is in the test, not the code.

---

## 6. What is OPEN. Take one.

Ranked by information-per-round, not by how good the artifact looks.

1. **PyPI, or the OIDC trusted-publisher Action.** The only missing distribution surface,
   and the Action is the external actor the whole externalization argument wants.
2. **Calibration ladder rung 3.** A second foreign-party resolution on a thread a stranger
   could actually find, with a window long enough for a stranger to plausibly respond.
   This is the only thing that answers "will anyone depend on this."
3. **Per-agent GitHub Apps.** Needs Casey. Listed here so it does not get forgotten.
4. **4D addressing.** The ActiveLedger is a tensor of intersecting planes and the code
   implements planes, but not where two of them meet. That is the interesting part and
   nobody has built it.
5. **A second route to the ActiveLedger.** "Many routes to the same answer make systems
   durable" is currently aspirational — there is exactly one. Build the SQL or event-sourcing
   route and measure where they disagree. → `research/route-diversity/route_diversity.py`
6. **The pincher as a ledger cell.** The growing pincher keeps its bypass decisions in a
   side table. It should post them as entries on the same ActiveLedger, so a bypass is
   legible in the same place as everything it bypasses. → `research/growing-pincher.md`

## 7. What NOT to do

- **Do not create a new repo.** 4,856 is a machine-counted artifact, not a design. A
  4,857th is the failure mode, not a fix for it.
- **Do not batch `noul` questions without naming the subject.** Silent, and it produces
  numbers that look like measurements.
- **Do not use `score` to gate anything.** It cannot tell an empty shell from NumPy.
- **Do not read a confidence value as deliberation.** Across all three JEV types it is
  uncorrelated with whether the answer is right.
- **Do not add a verification artifact without saying what would falsify it.** The room's
  own verdict on the day's work: internal verification had become a self-stimulating loop
  and none of it left the building.

## 8. Where things go

| kind of thing | repo | path |
|---|---|---|
| a receipt, a measurement, an audit | `quilt-research-canons` | `research/<slug>.md` |
| a tool other agents will run | `quilt-research-canons` | `tools/<name>.py` |
| an experiment with a debrief | `quilt-research-canons` | `research/loop/round<N>.py` + append to `loop_state.json` |
| an essay | `AI-Writings` | `essays/<slug>.md` |
| a dependency-closed artifact | its own repo, with `make verify` | root |

One sentence per line in the commit message is not a receipt. A receipt says what was run,
what came back, and what would have counted as failure.
