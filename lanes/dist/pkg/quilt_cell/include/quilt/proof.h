/* quilt/proof.h — the PROOF opcode (Phase 216 cutting-edge adoption #1).
 *
 * Idea: signed hash-linked audit chain per cell. The cell's journal
 * becomes a tamper-evident ring. Each entry is:
 *
 *   prev_hash || ed25519_sig(cell_state_at_t) || cell_state
 *
 * Adopted from:
 *   - astrid-runtime/astrid (capability-mediated audit chain)
 *   - InterSAGE (capability-aware trust substrate)
 *   - Bounded Agents / APC (formally proves Blast Radius Monotonicity)
 *
 * In a kernel-friendly build we use SHA-256 (in core) and the
 * ed25519-dalek crate when std is available. This header is
 * deliberately minimal: a ring buffer of entries, a finalize() that
 * signs the chain, and a verify() that walks it.
 *
 * The polyformalism promise: this lives behind the opcode set, not
 * the language. A PROOF cell on a Cloudflare Worker uses Workers
 * Crypto; on ESP32 it uses mbedTLS; on the host it uses OpenSSL.
 * Same 5+1 opcodes, different substrate.
