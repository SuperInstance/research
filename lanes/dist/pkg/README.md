# ⚙️ quilt-c

> **The Quilt cell-fabric runtime in C99.** Part of the [polyformalism](https://github.com/SuperInstance/quilt-claude-charts/blob/main/QUILT_CHARTER.md) — the same cell model, expressed in 12+ languages, byte-exact compatible.

## ✦ Why this port exists

The C99 port of the Quilt. The C99 port is distinctive because of its position in the language hierarchy — `gcc-compileable, C99-idiomatic, byte-exact with the rest of the polyformalism.

## ✦ The 5 opcodes

```
BIND(cell, dials)   # set dials, idempotent
LINK(c1, c2)        # add an undirected edge
EFFECT(cell)        # propagate dial[0] to neighbors
VIEW(cell)          # return dials
TICK(fabric)        # advance all dials by 1, alternating direction
```

The canonical serialization is `type(1) || id(8 LE) || dials(32 LE) || neighbors(8*N LE)`. The state hash is FNV-1a 64-bit. The test cell (id=1, dials=[1..16], neighbors=[2,3,4]) produces `0xe435d91d6d92a1d8` byte-exactly.

## Run it in under 10 seconds

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SuperInstance/quilt-c.git
cd quilt-c
make verify
```

That is the whole dependency closure: a C99 compiler and `python3`. No packages, no
lockfile, no network. `make verify` builds every suite, runs all 1,285 assertions
across 7 suites, and writes `VERIFY_RECEIPT.json` containing the verdict, the
assertion counts, a sha256 of the source tree, and a sha256 of the receipt itself.
It is fail-closed: any failing suite exits nonzero.

Receipt shape:

```json
{
  "schema": "quilt-c/verify-receipt@v1",
  "verdict": "VERIFIED",
  "assertions_passed": 1285,
  "assertions_failed": 0,
  "suites": 7,
  "source_tree_sha256": "8f027b799fc819b02c04392781ed854e...",
  "receipt_sha256": "91d52448f0748c866d0facccbea3cb5e..."
}
```

Anyone can re-run this and compare the tree hash. If the source changes, the hash
changes; if the behaviour changes, the assertion count changes. That is the
reproducibility contract, stated in one command.

## ✦ The educational root

Every port points back to the [Quilt Charter](https://github.com/SuperInstance/quilt-claude-charts/blob/main/QUILT_CHARTER.md) — the educational root document.

## ✦ Build

```sh
make            # builds build/libquilt-c.a (a static library)
make test       # compiles and runs the conformance + laws test suite
```

The 5+1 opcodes (`BIND / LINK / EFFECT / VIEW / TICK / FORGET`) and all 5 laws (BIND idempotence, LINK transitivity, VIEW purity, TICK monotonicity, FORGET completeness) are tested in `tests/test_engine.c`. The test target ships with **38 assertions, all green** on C99.

The public API is one header: [`include/quilt/cell.h`](include/quilt/cell.h). The runtime is one file: [`src/engine.c`](src/engine.c). The polyformalism promise: same cell, same 5+1 opcodes, expressed in the language of kernels.

```c
#include <quilt/cell.h>

quilt_engine_t e;
quilt_cell_t cells[16];
quilt_engine_init(&e, cells, 16);

quilt_bind(&e, "a", quilt_v_int(2));
quilt_bind(&e, "b", quilt_v_int(3));
/* ... link, effect, view, tick, forget ... */

quilt_engine_free(&e);
```

`make` produces `build/libquilt-c.a` (a static library) and `build/test_engine` (the test binary). No external dependencies. C99. Runs in kernel space.
