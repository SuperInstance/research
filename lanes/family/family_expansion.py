family_expansion.py — the experiment that was missing.

The previous instrument measured SIX lattices at ONE size each. The theorem is
asymptotic. `research/locality/locality_spectrum.py` said so explicitly:

    "A single fixed-size graph cannot test an asymptotic statement."

This file grows FAMILIES and measures the trend, which is the only way to see the
mechanism rather than a snapshot of it.

THE QUESTION

Does conductance DECAY as the lattice grows, as Hutchcroft-Munch (arXiv:2512.03968)
predict for non-negatively curved bounded-degree graphs?

    log #B(x,r) <= exp(C_d sqrt(log r)) = r^{o(1)}      and      E[d^2] <= n^{1+o(1)}

THE SUBTLETY, WHICH IS THE ACTUAL FINDING

Salez (GAFA 2022) proves this at the level of **Benjamini-Schramm limits** -- that is, for
TYPICAL random rooted graphs, and he explicitly says the two properties are incompatible
"at infinity" before transferring to finite graphs by local weak convergence.

So the honest prediction is NOT "every non-negatively curved family decays." It is:

    TYPICAL families (random d-regular)  ->  curvature is NEGATIVE, and they expand.
    STRUCTURED families (tori)          ->  curvature is 0, and they ALSO expand.

And that, if true, is a real and useful result: **the theorem is about how a lattice is
GROWN, not about its size.** A torus and a random d-regular graph of the same n and the
same degree sit at opposite ends, and the difference is structure, not scale.

Which is the fleet's own doctrine arriving from an unexpected direction: the substrate is
grown, not designed, and "grown" is load-bearing in a measurable way.
